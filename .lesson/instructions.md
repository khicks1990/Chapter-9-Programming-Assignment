# Instructions  

Imagine you are developing a software package for Amazon.com that requires users to enter their own passwords. Your software requires that usersâ€™ passwords meet the following criteria:


The password should be at least six characters long.
The password should contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter.
The password should have at least one digit.

Write a class that verifies that a password meets the stated criteria. Demonstrate the class in a program that allows the user to enter a password and then displays a message indicating whether it is valid or not.
